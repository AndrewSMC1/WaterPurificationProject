# Water Purification Project

This project uses Python and Google Sheets analyze water purification systems. The project uses calculus, differential equations, and solving systems of simultaneous linear ODEs.

The physical concepts examined in this project include speed of flow, average flow, bending moment, modulus of elasticity, forces, and dilution.
